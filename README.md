# ising-model
Here is a simulator of ising model demo using p-bits.
We first construct a Max-Cut problem based on the input graph material. The simulation begins with a randomly initialized spin configuration. For each iteration of the optimization process, the total interaction from all other spins is computed for each individual spin. Based on the MAC reult of spin states and corresponding interaction Coefficient sum, the next spin state is computed using p-bit file and updated in the subsequent iteration . Unlike traditional architectures, our approach directly performs annealing and spin state judgement just in the analog domain using p-bits, thereby achieving significant power savings. We implement a full system-level dataflow simulator in Python to model the overall architecture. The detailed implementation code can be found in the supplementary material.
